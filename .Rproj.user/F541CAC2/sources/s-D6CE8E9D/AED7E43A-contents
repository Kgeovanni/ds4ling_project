### Set-Up:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lme4)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(patchwork)
library(dplyr)
library(lme4)
library(readr)
```

### Article Introduction 
***The ontogeny of visual-motor memory and its importance in handwriting and reading: a developing construct***

Waterman, Havelka, Culmer, Hill, and Mon-Williams (2015) conducted a cross-sectional study to examine if working motor memory interacted with writing ability and reading skills. They shared their data as an open source.


### Dataset Loaded and Explored
The raw data available in csv format was loaded and explored. 
```{r, load_data}
data_raw <- read_csv("data_raw/data_raw.csv")
View(data_raw)
summary(data_raw)
```

The first six rows of data_raw, provided by the authors is shown in the table below. 
```{r, summary}
head(data_raw) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "First Six Rows of Raw Data") %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

### Tidy Data
Data was organized using pivot_longer(). Columns in the raw data set were separated by names and values.
```{r, data_longer}
data_longer <- data_raw %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Shape1_OE:Shape9_OE, 
    names_to = "shape", 
    values_to = "OE"
  ) %>%
  mutate(shape = factor(parse_number(shape))) %>%  
  select(ID, YearGroup_School, Sex, Age_Cat, Reading_converted, 
         Writing_converted, shape, OE)

head(data_longer) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Tidy Data with pivot_longer()") %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
Data was organized using select(). Specific Columns from raw data set were selected.
```{r, data_tidy}
data_tidy <- data_raw %>% 
  select(ID, YearGroup_School, Sex, Age_Cat, Reading_converted, 
         Writing_converted, OE_avg_simple, OE_avg_medium, OE_avg_hard,OE_avg_overall)

head(data_tidy) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Tidy Data with select()") %>% 
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

### Plot the Data
#### Scatter Plots
Initial thought was to use a scatter plot to compare age and OE variables, however, age is not a continuous variable and boxplots appeared to be more appropriate. Below are examples of initial exploration plots.

```{r, plot}
  data_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age_Cat, y = OE_avg_simple, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Age Groups") +
  ylab("OE Measurement for Simple Shapes") +
  ggtitle("Age and Average OE for Simple Shapes ")
```
```{r, }
data_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y = OE_avg_hard)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4, width = 0.2) +
  xlab("Sex") +
  ylab("OE Measurement for Hard Shapes") +
  ggtitle("Age and Average OE for Hard Shapes ")
```


#### Boxplots
In the boxplot below we can conclude that about 25% of our OE data has a value less than 3, our median value is about 4.5, and 75% of our data is less than 7. There are many data points (i.e., outliers) above 11 and that data has a positive skew.
```{r}
boxplot(data_longer$OE)
```
Boxplots for age group and simple shapes.
```{r, boxplot_OEsimple}
data_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age_Cat, y = OE_avg_simple)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Average OE of Simple Shapes")
```
Boxplots for age group and medium shapes.
```{r, boxplot_OEmedium}
data_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age_Cat, y = OE_avg_medium)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Average OE of Medium Shapes")
```

Boxplots for age group and hard shapes.
```{r, boxplot_OEhard}
data_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age_Cat, y = OE_avg_hard)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Average OE of Hard Shapes")
```



***Facet*** analysis is used below to look at the relationship between different variables (i.e., sex and OE performance of the nine shapes).
```{r, facet}
data_longer %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y = OE)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(shape)) +
  ggtitle("Gender Performance of Optimized Error (OE) Across Nine Shapes") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r}
data_longer %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = shape, y = OE)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(Sex)) +
  ggtitle("Gender Performance of Optimized Error (OE) Across Nine Shapes")
```
### Data Description Analyses

#### 
```{r}
Gender_OE <- aov(OE~Sex + shape, data = data_longer)
```


```{r}
summary(Gender_OE)
```

A Tukey's HSD test was used after an ANOVA test to compare which groups' means are different; essentially comparing all possible pairs of means.
```{r}
TukeyHSD(Gender_OE) #we need a post hoc test to compare groups
```


#### Data Description Analysis for Sex (Female and Male)
Male and Female performance for the average score of the three-level (simple, medium, hard) shape complexity waere analyzed. 
```{r, OE_summarize}
data_description <- data_raw %>% 
  group_by(Sex) %>% 
   summarize(MeanOE_simple = mean(OE_avg_simple),
            sdOE_simple = sd(OE_avg_simple),
            MeanOE_medium = mean(OE_avg_medium),
            sdOE_medium = sd(OE_avg_medium),
            MeanOE_hard = mean(OE_avg_hard),
            sdOE_hard = sd(OE_avg_hard))

data_description %>% 
 kbl(caption = "Gender Comparison of Optimized Error (OE) for Visual Motor Memory (VMM)") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

#### Data Description Analysis 
A linear regression model was completed to fit models
```{r}
sex_OEhard<-lm(OE_avg_hard~Sex, data = data_tidy)
```
t-test used to determine significant difference between groups.
```{r}
t.test(OE_avg_hard~Sex, data = data_tidy)
```

```{r}
summary(aov(sex_OEhard))
summary(sex_OEhard)
```

### Histogram Analysis
Data frame residuals is extracted from sex_OEhard. Model is skewed left.
```{r}
hist(sex_OEhard$residuals)
```
